Adding labels to a dataset is very important before you can use it to solve a problem. One of those problems where adding labels to a dataset is very important is sentiment analysis, where you get the data as reviews or comments from users, and you need to add labels to it to prepare it for sentiment analysis. So, if you want to learn how to label unlabeled data, this code is for you. Professor Lee will present a tutorial on how to add labels to a dataset for sentiment analysis using Python.","metadata":{},"id":"5c37e076-82a0-400d-95cf-497758d7f6d2"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install nltk\n!pip install openpyxl","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"c354561b-e09d-4295-90cc-80c60393a1cf"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import nltk\nfrom nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\nnltk.download(\"vader_lexicon\")\nimport pandas as pd\n# data = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/reviews%20data.csv\")\n# data = data.dropna()\n# print(data.head())","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"4c052b50-ed05-4ed0-ba66-b0fadd1e1d46"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"excel_file = pd.ExcelFile('Texas Last Statement - Excel.xlsx')\n# View the excel_file's sheet names\nprint(excel_file.sheet_names)\n  \n# Load the excel_file's Sheet1 as a dataframe\ndf = excel_file.parse('Sheet1')\n# df = df.dropna()\n\nprint(df.T)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"b7ff4b82-f8d8-487b-9568-0443aa5f2c72"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So this dataset contains many columns, and I will now move to the task of adding labels to the dataset.
